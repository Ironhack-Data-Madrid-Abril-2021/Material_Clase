# Module 3: Week 7-9

## Module Description

In this module, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of machine learning. You will learn how to use the Scikit-Learn machine learning library to build, evaluate, and deploy models. You will also learn about the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, the basics of machine learning algorithms, and how to build machine learning pipelines.

By the end of this module, you will have built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that preprocesses a dataset, extracts features, trains a model, and saves that model to disk so that it can be used to predict on future data. Upon completion, you will have the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to datasets in the real world!

## Module Objectives

* Gain an understanding of machine learning (ML) and the ML workflow.
* Get familiar with the Scikit-Learn library for ML.
* Understand supervised and unsupervised learning and be able to apply ML methods in data analysis.
* Learn how to build ML pipelines to analyze data in the real-world.
* Prepare you for your final project in which youâ€™ll perform ML analysis on real-world data to solve real-world business problems.
