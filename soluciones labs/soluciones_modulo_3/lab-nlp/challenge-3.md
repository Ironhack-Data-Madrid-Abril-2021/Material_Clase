# Challenge 3: Sentiment Analysis

In this challenge we will learn sentiment analysis and practice performing sentiment analysis end-to-end on Twitter tweets. 

**Suggested time on this challenge: 3-4 Hours**

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is to *systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information* based on texts ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)). In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.

Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.

Also, NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package requires only the textual data to make predictions on sentiment. For example:

```python
>>> from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
>>> txt = "Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide.   Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do."
>>> analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
>>> analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}
```

NLTK's sentiment analysis package is great for dummies but we will not use it in this challenge. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. So instead we will use a ML algorithm called Naive Bayes to more accurately classify the tweets taking advantage of the coded data.

## Understanding Naive Bayes

So far we have only worked with discriminative statistical models such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and SVM. Those models are called *discriminative* because they classify data by identifying the boundaries between various classes. Another main approach in statistical classification is called [generative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). Generative models look at how the data are generated by identifying the function with which various classes are distinguished. And a widely used generative model is [Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) (NB).

Watch the following video to have a general understanding of NB:

### Key Knowledge Points

* How are features generated in NB?
* Why does NB expect the features are independent?
* What is posterial probability?
* Why is it called *naive*?
* What are the pros and cons of NB?
* What are the areas of application of NB?

Additional knowledge is NB requires a smaller sample size than LR and RF in order to produce reliable predictions. This is also a major advantage of NB that the video does not mention. In our sentiment analysis lab today, we'll use NB as the text classifier.

## Conducting Sentiment Analysis

### Loading and Exploring Data

The dataset we'll be using today is located in the lab directory named `Sentiment140.csv.zip`. You need to unzip it into a `.csv` file. Then in your Jupyter Notebook, load and explore the data.

*Notes:* 

* The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). We made a slight change on the original data so that each column has a label.

* The dataset is huuuuge (1.6m tweets). When you develop your data analysis codes, you can sample a subset of the data (e.g. 20k records) so that you will save a lot of time when you test your codes.

### Prepare Textual Data for Sentiment Analysis

Now, apply the functions you have written in Challenge 2 to your whole data set. These functions include:

* `clean_up()`

* `tokenize()`

* `stem_and_lemmatize()`

* `remove_stopwords()`

Create a new column called `text_processed` in the dataframe to contain the processed data. At the end, your `text_processed` column should contain lists of word tokens that are cleaned up. Your data should look like below:

![Processed Data](data-cleaning-results.png)

### Creating Bag of Words

The purpose of this step is to create a [bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) from the processed data. The bag of words contains all the unique words in your whole text body (a.k.a. *corpus*) with the number of occurrence of each word. It will allow you to understand which words are the most important features across the whole corpus.

Also, you can imagine you will have a massive set of words. The less important words (i.e. those of very low number of occurrence) do not contribute much to the sentiment. Therefore, you only need to use the most important words to build your feature set in the next step. In our case, we will use the top 5,000 words with the highest frequency to build the features.

In your Jupyter Notebook, combine all the words in `text_processed` and calculate the frequency distribution of all words. A convenient library to calculate the term frequency distribution is NLTK's `FreqDist` class ([documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#module-nltk.probability)). Then select the top 5,000 words from the frequency distribution.

### Building Features

Now let's build the features. Using the top 5,000 words, create a 2-dimensional matrix to record whether each of those words is contained in each document (tweet). Then you also have an output column to indicate whether the sentiment in each tweet is positive. For example, assuming your bag of words has 5 items (`['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']`) out of 4 documents (`['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`), your feature set is essentially:

| Doc | one | two | three | four | five | is_positive |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | True | False | False | True | False | True |
| B | False | False | False | True | True | False |
| C | False | True | False | False | False | True |
| D | True | False | False | False | True | False|

However, because the `nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train` class we will use in the next step does not work with Pandas dataframe, the structure of your feature set should be:

```python
[
	({
		'one': True,
		'two': False,
		'three': False,
		'four': True,
		'five': False
	}, True),
	({
		'one': False,
		'two': False,
		'three': False,
		'four': True,
		'five': True
	}, False),
	({
		'one': False,
		'two': True,
		'three': False,
		'four': False,
		'five': False
	}, True),
	({
		'one': True,
		'two': False,
		'three': False,
		'four': False,
		'five': True
	}, False)
]
```

To help you in this step, watch the following video to learn how to build the feature set with Python and NLTK.

### Building and Traininng Naive Bayes Model

In this step you will split your feature set into a training and a test set. Then you will create a Bayes classifier instance using `nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train` ([example](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html)) to train with the training dataset.

After training the model, call `classifier.show_most_informative_features()` to inspect the most important features. The output will look like:

```
Most Informative Features
	    snow = True            False : True   =     34.3 : 1.0
	  easter = True            False : True   =     26.2 : 1.0
	 headach = True            False : True   =     20.9 : 1.0
	    argh = True            False : True   =     17.6 : 1.0
	unfortun = True            False : True   =     16.9 : 1.0
	    jona = True             True : False  =     16.2 : 1.0
	     ach = True            False : True   =     14.9 : 1.0
	     sad = True            False : True   =     13.0 : 1.0
	  parent = True            False : True   =     12.9 : 1.0
	  spring = True            False : True   =     12.7 : 1.0
```

### Testing Naive Bayes Model

Now we'll test our classifier with the test dataset. This is done by calling `nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test)`.

As mentioned in one of the tutorial videos, a Naive Bayes model is considered OK if your accuracy score is over 0.6. If your accuracy score is over 0.7, you've done a great job!

## Bonus Question 1: Improve Model Performance

If you are still not exhausted so far and want to dig deeper, try to improve your classifier performance. There are many aspects you can dig into, for example:

* Improve stemming and lemmatization. Inspect your bag of words and the most important features. Are there any words you should furuther remove from analysis? You can append these words to further remove to the stop words list.

* Remember we only used the top 5,000 features to build model? Try using different numbers of top features. The bottom line is to use as few features as you can without compromising your model performance. The fewer features you select into your model, the faster your model is trained. Then you can use a larger sample size to improve your model accuracy score.

## Bonus Question 2: Machine Learning Pipeline

In a new Jupyter Notebook, combine all your codes into a function (or a class). Your new function will execute the complete machine learning pipeline job by receiving the dataset location and output the classifier. This will allow you to use your function to predict the sentiment of any tweet in real time. 

## Bonus Question 3: Apache Spark

If you have completed the Apache Spark advanced topic lab, what you can do is to migrate your pipeline from local to a Databricks Notebook. Share your notebook with your instructor and classmates to show off your achievements!
