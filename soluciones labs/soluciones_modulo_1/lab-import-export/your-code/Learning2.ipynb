    "\n",
    "    Learn how to rename columns in a data frame.\n",
    "    Change the order of a data frame's columns.\n",
    "    Filter records based on conditional statements.\n",
    "    Create additional categories via binning and conditional statements.\n",
    "    Learn how to one-hot encode categorical variables.\n",
    "    Combine data frames via merging and concatenation.\n",
    "    Melt data from wide format into long format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons Pandas has become such a popular tool for data analysts over the last few years is because it makes data transformation and manipulation much faster and easier. In this lesson, we will take a look at how to rename and restructure data as we prepare it to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, we will be using the same vehicles data set that we practiced importing and exporting in the Import and Export lesson. Let's go ahead and import the CSV version of the data set and see what it actually looks like."

    "There are a couple of important things to note here. First, when you want to apply multiple conditions, you need to use an \"and\" operator (&) or an \"or\" operator (|) between your conditions. The \"and\" operator will return records where both of the conditions surrounding it are true, and the \"or\" operator will return records where either of the conditions surrounding it are true. The second thing to note is that all our conditional statements are enclosed in parentheses. This is easy to forget, but necessary or else your results will be incorrect.\n",

    "When preparing data to be analyzed, one of the things that is useful to do is to create additional categorical variables. Categorical variables allow you to group records in different ways, and each way that you categorize them can provide you with a different perspective when you're conducting your analysis. A common way of creating additional categorical fields is to bin numeric variables in a column based on how relatively high or low they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, our data set has a Combined MPG variable that tells us how many miles per gallon of gasoline the vehicle can travel - in other words, the vehicle's fuel efficiency. However, it isn't easy to tell whether a vehicle has low or high fuel efficiency just by looking at the numbers. To help with this, we can bin the values in the Combined MPG field into an intuitive number of categories.\n",

    "# Melting Data Into Long Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vehicles data set currently has a wide format, where there is a column for each attribute. However, some analytic and visualization tasks will require that the data be in a long format, where there are a few variables that define the entities and then all other attribute information is condensed into two columns: one containing the column/attribute names and another containing the value for that attribute for each entity. Pandas makes it easy to format data this way with the melt function. For example, suppose we were going to perform some analysis or visualization task where we needed the Year, Make, and Model to identify the vehicles and then we also needed the City MPG, Highway MPG, and Combined MPG fields for performing various calculations. Below is how we would melt the data into the proper format. "
