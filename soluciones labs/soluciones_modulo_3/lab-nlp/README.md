# Lab | Introduction to Natural Language Processing

## Introduction

In Module 1, if you remember, you learned about Text Mining. You also practiced how to create a Bag of Words using Python. That early introductory lesson discussed some concepts such as *tokenization*, *stemming*, and *lemmatization* which are typical techniques you can use in Natural Languages Processing(NLP). In this lab, you will learn how to use these techniques in action and conduct sentiment analysis (one type of NLP) on Twitter tweeets.

In this lab we cite some external resources for you to learn, which includes YouTube videos and web references. Soon you will graduate from this bootcamp and become a data analyst in practice. By then you will rely heavily on web resources to learn new knowledge. You will need to learn how to identify useful information, disgard irrelevant information, and evaluate the accuracy and timeliness of the information. This is the only way you will excel as a data expert.

### Objectives

* Learn about NLP.
* Install and test NLTK, a popular library created for NLP.
* Learn how to use NLTK to conduct sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

Take Challenge 1-3 in order. Create Jupyter Notebooks as appropriate to code your answers.

## Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebooks containing your responses.

## Submission

* Submit the deliverables via git.
